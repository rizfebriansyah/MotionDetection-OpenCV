# MotionDetection-OpenCV
 
To create a software application that uses video footage from a camera to detect and track moving cars, as well as counting the number of vehicles that travel from the city's centre to the downtown over a specific period of time.

The programme will run on a Python Jupyter notebook, make use of the OpenCV library, and be based on frame differencing and background subtraction methods. 

Do run the the .ipynb files in Jupyter Notebook.
Each file will tackle the respective tasks assigned. 

Task 1 - Detecting vehicles on the main street:
